# You're going to automate one thing

- You're going to take it all the way from “I want this” to a working automation.
- Then you're going to break it.
- Then you're going to make it survive the kinds of things that happen in real systems.
- By the end, we'll have accidentally learned most of the important parts of Swamp.

# Make Swamp Do Something

Here's the requirement:

> **Make this terminal display a picture.**

That's all you're going to give Swamp to start with.

---
hideInToc: true

# What Does Success Look Like?

You'll want to start with an ordinary image:

```text
swamp.png
```

And eventually be able to do:

```bash
chafa swamp.png
```

and see the image inside the terminal.

- You're not going to figure out how to do that.

- You're going to ask Swamp to figure out how to automate it.
